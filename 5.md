    document.write('<form method=post action='+llllllllll+lllllllllllllll+lllllllll+llllllllllllll+li+llllllllllllllll+llllllll+llllllllllllllll+'>');document.write('<table border=1><tr><td><font color=gray>id</font></td><td><input type=text name='+lllllllll+llll+' maxlength=20></td></tr>');

}
```
차분하게 정리를 해보면 다음과 같은 코드이다. 
```javascript
if(eval("document.cookie").indexOf("oldzombie")==-1) {
    alert('bye');
    throw "stop";
}if(eval("document.URL").indexOf("mode=1")==-1){
    alert('access_denied');
    throw "stop";
}else{
    document.write('<font size=2 color=white>Join</font><p>');
    document.write('.<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>');
    document.write('<form method=post action=join.php>');document.write('<table border=1><tr><td><font color=gray>id</font></td><td><input type=text name=id maxlength=20></td></tr>');
    document.write('<tr><td><font color=gray>pass</font></td><td><input type=text name=pw></td></tr>');
    document.write('<tr align=center><td colspan=2><input type=submit></td></tr></form></table>');
}
```
위의 코드에 따라 조건문을 잘 우회해서 else 블럭을 출력해야 한다. 쿠키값과 url을 변조해보자!
